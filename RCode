Simulations <- 10000   # Number of scenarios to simulate
Events <- 4            # Number of expected annual events to materialize (Poisson distribution)
Loss <- 100            # Expected average financial loss per event (Lognormal distribution)
Mean <- .2             # Standard deviation of the losses in R

# Simulate Poisson-distributed random variables (number of events)
Prob <- rpois(Simulations, Events)

# Simulate Lognormal-distributed random variables (financial loss per event)
Impact <- rlnorm(Simulations, log(Loss), Mean)

# Calculate the total loss for each scenario
x <- Prob * Impact

# Display a summary of the simulated data
summary(x)

# Create a histogram of the simulated losses
hist(x)

# Calculate the 75th percentile of the simulated losses
quantile(x, c(0.75))
