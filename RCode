# Project Risk quantification in R. A repository for simulating and analyzing risk scenarios in R.

# Status This project is actively being developed and is in the production  stage.

# Tags/Topics - Risk management - Data Analysis - R

# Data input
Simulations <- 10000   # Number of scenarios to simulate
Events <- 4            # Number of expected annual events to materialize (Poisson distribution)
Loss <- 20000          # Expected average financial loss per event (Lognormal distribution)
Mean <- .2             # Standard deviation of the losses in R
Reserve <- .8          # This percentile is a measure of the risk exposure, indicating the level of loss that would be lower in a specific proportion of the simulated scenarios

# Simulate Poisson-distributed random variables (number of events)
Prob <- rpois(Simulations, Events)

# Simulate Lognormal-distributed random variables (financial loss per event)
Impact <- rlnorm(Simulations, log(Loss), Mean)

# Calculate the total loss for each scenario
x <- Prob * Impact

# Display a summary of the simulated data
summary(x)

# Create a histogram of the simulated losses
hist(x)

# Calculate the given percentile of the simulated losses
quantile(x, c(Reserve))

# Graph a Loss Exceedance Curve
number_sequence = seq(0.1,1,0.01)
y <- c()
for (i in number_sequence) {
y <- c(y,quantile (x, c(i))) }
plot(number_sequence,y)

# Graph a the Annual Loss Expectancy
boxplot(x)
